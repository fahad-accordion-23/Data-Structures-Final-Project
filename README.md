# Data Structures Final Project

This repo is for my final data structures project at FAST NUCES, 2025.

## Build Instructions and Libraries

My project does not have a CMake configuration yet. You would have to use Visual Studio to build or configure CMake yourself.

### Installing SFML Using vcpkg

`vcpkg install sfml:x86-windows` for x86 and `vcpkg install sfml:x64-windows` for x64 builds.

## Acknowledgements
